  <p>This is where my wife and I were married. I love staying at the Ocean Beach Hotel that is only feet from the ocean!</h3>
  <p>There are amazing tide pools and the sunset cliffs are stunning!</p>

  <p>Even tho I was raised in Utah I had <strong>never</strong> been to this waterfall before I met my wife! It is her favorite place in Utah and I love being able to take her there when I can.</p>
